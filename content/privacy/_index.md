### Data collection

Google Analytics temporarily joins these identifiers to your Google Analytics data in order to support your audiences. When you enable this setting, you must adhere to the Google Analytics Advertising Features Policy, including rules around sensitive categories and the necessary privacy disclosures to your end users about the data you collect and share with Google.

### Data retention

### PS

The only reason I want to collect data about your visits to this site is to understand which articles are popular and which are not. This is important for me as an author, because sometimes I don't get any other feedback.

This website is a static website, so I don't have server logs to analyze it. Instead, I need to use 3-rd party service provider to collect analytics (**Google analytics**).
